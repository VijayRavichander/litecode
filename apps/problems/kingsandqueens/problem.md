## Kings or Queens

In this version of chess, knights move "a" tiles in one direction and \( b \) tiles in the other. The chessboard is infinite, and the king and queen are placed on cells "(x_K, y_K)" and "(x_Q, y_Q)" respectively. Determine the number of positions where a knight can attack both the king and the queen.

#### Test case 1

Input

```
a = 2
b = 1
x_k = 0
y_k = 0
x_q = 3
y_q = 3
```
